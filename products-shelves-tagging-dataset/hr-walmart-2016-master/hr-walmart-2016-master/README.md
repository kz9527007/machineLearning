# Solution to HackerRank WalmartLabs Codesprint (Machine Learning)

Problem Name: **Products on Virtual Shelves**

For now this repo only contains the abridged version of code that generated my final submission, with non-essential analytics and visualization removed. In the future I might do some cleanup and put in those code for reference.

Suggestions and PR are welcomed.

## Prerequisites

* R
    - pacman
* Python
    - pandas >= 0.19.0
    - scikit-learn >= 0.18
    - keras (latest)
    - scipy >= 0.18.1
    - numpy >= 1.11.2
    - jupyter >= 1.0.0

## How to reproduce

1. Put train.tsv and test.tsv into *data* folder
1. Rscript prepare_labels.R
1. Run FinalSubmission.ipynb in Jupyter

## Possible Future Works

1. Ensemble with other models
2. Advanced Text Processing: nltk, spacy...
